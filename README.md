# Module-2-Challenge-Portfolio-EDx-Bootcamp

## Description

This repository was created to complete challenge 2 for the front-end web development bootcamp. I built this project using HTML and CSS. I used CSS flexbox, CSS grid and media queries to build a responsive design.

## Live Website

My live portfolio can be found here: <a href="https://ibrahim-mohamed45.github.io/Module-2-Challenge-Portfolio-EDx-Bootcamp/" target="_blank">Ibrahim Mohamed's Portfolio</a>

## Acceptance Criteria

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

The porfolio should look like this gif:
